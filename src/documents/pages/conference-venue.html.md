SSRR 2012 will be held at the Hilton Hotel in College Station, Texas, which is the home of Texas A&M University. College Station is accessible by plane with frequent connections from Dallas and Houston to the Easterwood Airport in College Station. (CLL is the airport code). The nearest major international airport is Houston Intercontinental (HOU), which is a 90 minute drive by rental car.

Taxi service from Houston to College Station is not an option but a shared multi-passenger shuttle can be arranged at http://groundshuttle.net/CollegeStation/Default.aspx for approximately $30USD or a town car. College Station is a two hour drive or shuttle from Austin, Texas (AUS).

College Station is in eastern Texas (where Shelton Cooper on "The Big Bang Theory" is from), not western Texas, so don't expect a desert with cactus.

Do expect cowboy hats, big trucks, big steaks, oil wells, and friendly people. November temperatures.
