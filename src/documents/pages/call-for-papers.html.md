##Call for Papers

##IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics
##Nov. 5-8, 2012

##Theme: 10 Years and Beyond!

The 10th anniversary of the IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics with continue its tradition of attracting cutting-edge papers in the theory and practice of robots for rapid and secure inspection of critical infrastructure, travelers,luggage, and paces; disaster response and recovery; humanitarian demining, disaster mitigation and recovery; detection of chemical, biological and radiological risks and operations in these dangerous sites; etc

SSRR 2012 will also serve as an entry point for researchers and technologists who want to learn more about SSR robotics, through tutorials and keynotes including:

 * Dr. Gill Pratt, DARPA Grand Robotics Challenge
 * Dr. Richard Voyles, NSF National Robotics Initiative
 * Prof. Hajime Asama, University of Tokyo, Nuclear Decommissioning
 * Prof. Satoshi Tadokoro, Tohoku University, Retrospective of RoboCup
   Rescue Contributions

The conference is co-located with Disaster CityÂ® and will host demonstrations organized around challenge problems (TBD), plan to bring your robots!

Papers and participation fall into: 

 * regular papers (4-6 pages) that describe original work in SSR or work that can be applied to SSR domains
 * center/project papers (2-4 pages) that describe work at centers or active multi-institutional projects 
 * Outrageous Visions for Computing papers (2-4) that present long-term challenges or new ideas outside of the mainstream in computing for SSR
robotics

Topics include but are not limited to:

 * Biologically inspired solutions
 * Casualty assessment, care and extraction
 * Chemical, biological, or radiological events
 * Computer vision
 * GPS-denied navigation and mapping
 * Humanoid robots
 * Humanitarian demining
 * Human-robot interaction
 * Inspection of critical infrastructure
 * Manipulation
 * Multi-agent coordination
 * Nuclear decommissioning
 * Sensing and sensor fusion
 * SLAM in extreme environments
 * Structural assessment
 * Telemedicine
 * Unmanned ground, aerial, and marine vehicles
 * Urban search and rescue 
 * Wildland fire fighting

In addition, SSRR 2012 encourages the submission of "non-traditional" papers which contribute to understanding robot systems for Public Safety but may not have results in a Public Safety domain. 

SSRR 2012 will have four paper awards:

 * Best Paper Award
 * Best Student Paper Award
 * Best Non-Traditional Robotics Paper Award
 * Outrageous Visions for Computing in SSRR

###Page Late Breaking Reports due Oct 15
Late Breaking Reports appear in the proceedings, and are presented as posters- but are no more than 2 pages in length, in essence an extended abstract. They are intended to share novel directions or work which has not been fully analyzed or explored. Late Breaking Reports are reviewed and the relevance of the material to the SSR domains must be clear. Please send late breaking reports directly to murphy@cse.tamu.edu.

###Important Dates

 * **Jul 30, 2012** Submission of proposals for tutorials, special sessions
