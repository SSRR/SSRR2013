##Call for Papers
##IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics
##Oct. 21-26, 2013
##Link√∂ping, Sweden
##Theme: Cooperation and Collaboration

The 11th IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics continues its tradition of attracting cutting-edge papers in the theory and practice of robots for rapid and secure inspection of critical infrastructure, travelers, luggage, and paces; disaster response and recovery; humanitarian demining, disaster mitigation, and recovery; detection of chemical, biological and radiological risks, and operations in these dangerous sites; etc

SSRR 2013 will also serve as an entry point for researchers and technologists who want to learn more about SSR robotics, through tutorials and keynotes.

Nov 10-13, directly after the SSRR2013 conference, a Summer School on
Common Software Components for Search and Rescue Robots is organized
in collaboration with NIFTi EU project.

Papers and participation fall into:
* Regular papers (4-6 pages) that describe original work in SSR or work that can be applied to SSR domains.
* Center/project papers (2-4 pages) that describe work at centers or active multi-institutional projects.
* Outrageous Visions for Computing papers (2-4) that present long-term challenges or new ideas outside of the mainstream in computing for SSR robotics.
* Late Breaking Reports (1-2 pages) that contribute novel directions or work which has not been fully analyzed or explored. Late Breaking Reports are reviewed and the relevance of the material to the SSR domains must be clear.

Topics include but are not limited to:
* Biologically inspired solutions
* Casualty assessment, care and extraction
* Chemical, biological, or radiological events
* Computer vision
* GPS-denied navigation and mapping
* Humanoid robots
* Humanitarian demining
* Human-robot interaction
* Inspection of critical infrastructure
* Manipulation
* Multi-agent coordination
* Nuclear decommissioning
* Sensing and sensor fusion
* SLAM in extreme environments
* Structural assessment
* Telemedicine
* Unmanned ground, aerial, and marine vehicles
* Urban search and rescue
* Wildland fire fighting

In addition, SSRR 2013 encourages the submission of "non-traditional" papers which contribute to understanding robot systems for Public Safety but may not have results in a Public Safety domain.

SSRR 2013 will have three paper awards:
* Best Paper Award
* Best Student Paper Award
* Outrageous Visions for Computing in SSRR
